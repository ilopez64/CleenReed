Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Update

As the Postmates community continues to grow, we’re updating our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to reflect changes we’ve made to protect your privacy rights and provide greater transparency around the ways we collect, process, and use personal information as well as the terms under which you use the Platform. These changes will go into effect on April 17, 2019.

We encourage you read them in their entirety, but here are the highlights of what’s changing:


Privacy Policy: The updated Privacy Policy is easier to read and better describes the types of data we collect, how we collect it, how we use it, and with whom we share it. It accounts for new features and describes the role that data plays in helping us maintain trust, safety and reliability on the Platform.

Terms of Service: The Terms of Service have been reorganized to make it easier to understand and reflect new features on the Platform. For example, it reflects that you can now order food for pickup. The updated Terms also contain more detail about how Postmates may use content you provide to us, dispute resolution, and who to contact if you have a concern about copyright or IP infringement.


By continuing to use our services on or after April 17, 2019 you acknowledge and agree to our updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us via our Help Center.

Thank you for being a member of the Postmates community.
